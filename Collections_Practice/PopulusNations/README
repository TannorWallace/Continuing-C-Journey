When adding to a Dictionary you cannot use the same key twice. this is because KEYS are always UNIQUE! you cannot use a key more than once (with out handling the exception probably) or you will cause the program to crash with an UNHANDLED exception.

You CAN however add the same item with the SAME KEY as manytimes are you want.

with lists and arrays you can look up elements with the Array.Length and the List.Count Properties

to look things up in a case of a dictionary use "TryGetValue()" 

The property or method checks to see if the key value is present in the Dictionary.
