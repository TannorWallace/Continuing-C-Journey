OOP Module notes

1- PILLARS OF Object Oriented Programming
  * ENCAPSULATION *THE MOST IMPORTANT*- Allows us to hide details of our code.
  Methods like Public and Private allow for implicit controll over who can see the code and what parts of the programm can use the code across similar classes.
  *INHERITANCE- Gives us the ability to re-use code.
  *POLYMORPHISM- Allows for us to have objects of the same type but to have different behaviors.

  DRY (princical)- DONT.REPEAT.YOURSELF!!!
