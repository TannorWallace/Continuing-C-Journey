Things to remember

Arrays are great for when you know the FIXED length of an object. i.e. Four ninja turtles. will always be four. 

TMNT[0] = new NinjaTurtle{Name="Donny", Weapon="Staff"};
TMNT[1] = new NinjaTurtle{Name="Raph", Weapon="Sia"};
TMNT[2] = new NinjaTurtle{Name="Leo", Weapon="Katanas"};
TMNT[3] = new NinjaTurtle{Name="Mikey", Weapon="Chuks!"};
but if it is a number that is always in flux
like the number of avenger super heroes it is better to use a <LIST>
<LIST> lives in the "Using System.Collections.Generic;" namespace.

Below is the code for setting the first index of the array in the bands array to the band object.
***************************************
using System;

public class Venue
{
    public string Name;
    public Band[] Bands = new Band[2];

    public void AddBand(string name)
    {
        Band band = new Band();
        band.Name = name;
        Bands[0] = band;
    }

    public void Announce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name + " will have several bands playing tonight!");
    }
}
**********************************************
*METHOD OVERLOADING*
********************
In C# you can use method names over and over AS LONG AS IT HAS A DIFFERENT METHOD SIGNATURE 
a method signature consists of the method NAME and the SIGNATURE TYPES!

MethodName()
{
    whatMethodDoes;
}

MethodName(string THESE HAVE TO string BE DIFFERENT)
{
    whatMethodDoesDifferent;
}
